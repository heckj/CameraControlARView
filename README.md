# CameraControlARView

RealityKit includes an ARView class that works on macOS, but I found it very limited.
This package includes an ARView with explicit camera control, and a wrapper to use it with SwiftUI.

> NOTE: With macOS 15 and iOS 17, SwiftUI now has a RealityView support for both of those platforms to enable local rendering with RealityKit.
