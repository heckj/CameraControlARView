# ``MotionMode``

## Overview

``CameraControlledARView`` provides an ARView with the perspective camera controlled by keyboard, mouse, and gestures, as available on the platform.
The camera can be oriented and controlled with multiple schemes that allow different ranges and goals.
The default, ``MotionMode/arcball`` provides a consistent view of a single location within the RealityKit scene, focusing on orbiting around that location.
``MotionMode/firstperson`` allows you to move through the scene, as though you were walking through the view.
